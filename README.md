# Face Verification and Recognition
In this project, i will use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings.
Then, i will use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition
using the triplet loss function which i have implemented.
The dataset includes faces mapped with names of people who are to be allowed entry into the house.
(This mini-project is a part of Deep Learning specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
